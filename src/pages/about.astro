						The <strong>Henkaku Knowledge Engine</strong> is a living infrastructure for
						organizing, connecting, and sharing the research, ideas, and experiments generated
						by the Henkaku Center and its network of collaborators.
					</p>
					<p>
						Built to support and reflect the spirit of ongoing inquiry, the engine
						structures knowledge across formats and disciplines, making it discoverable,
						interoperable, and open to contribution. It powers core Henkaku
						initiatives—including the <em>Henkaku Day Symposium</em>, the <em
							>Journal of Design and Science</em
						>, and the <em>Research Observatory</em>—while also enabling new tools,
						interfaces, and methods for research exchange.
					</p>
					<p>
						Rather than publishing as a final step, the Knowledge Engine treats
						publishing as part of an evolving process—capturing not just polished
						outcomes, but the context, relationships, and iterations that surround them.
					</p>
					<p>
						We believe that knowledge grows through conversation. This is our way of
						building a space where those conversations can flourish.
